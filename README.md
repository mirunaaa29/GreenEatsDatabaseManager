# GreenEatsDatabaseManager

This project contains two folders: **SQLDatabase** and **FormApplication**.

## SQLDatabase
Contains all the work done for the Database course(3rd semester). This includes queries, indexing, testing, and stored procedures.

## FormApplication
A C# Windows Forms application that utilizes ADO.NET to interact with the database developed during the database course. The application facilitates manipulation of data in two tables that are in a one-to-many relationship (parent table and child table). The application provides the following functionalities:

- **Display all records in the parent table**: Users can view all the records stored in the parent table.
- **Display child records for a specific parent record**: Upon selecting a specific parent record, the application displays the corresponding child records associated with it.
- **Add / Remove / Update child records for a specific parent record**: Users can add, remove, or update child records linked to a specific parent record. This ensures efficient management of data within the one-to-many relationship.
